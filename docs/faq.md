## Blockchain

### Is zec-qt-wallet a light client?

No, zec-qt-wallet requires a full `zcashd` node to operate. A light client protocol is currently in development that would substantially reduce the storage and bandwidth requirements for a light wallet and once this development is complete...

### How large is the blockchain?

Currently the blockchain data directory is around 25GB (Feb, 2019) and will continue to grow with time.

### Can I move the data directory?

If you are starting zec-qt-wallet for the first time then you can choose the advanced configuration and select the location of your data directory, which may for example be on a seperate disk. If you have an existing data directory you would like to move, you can achieve this through the following steps:

* Create the new directory
* Copy your [existing data directory](#) to the new location
* Update [zcash.conf](#) with the `datadir=/your/new/path`
* Restart zec-qt-wallet

### Can I move the params directory?

No, unlike the data directory there is no configurable option to specify the params directory and `zcashd` expects the Params directory to be in the following locations:

//TODO check this

* Windows: `%HOMEPATH%\AppData\Roaming\ZcashParams`
* macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/ZcashParams`
* Linux: `~/.zcashparams`

As a workaround you can use any filesystem operations for your OS e.g. creating a sysmlink of the directory but these are unsupported.

## Transactions

### Can I use funds with zero confirmations?

### Can I remove shielded transactions sends from persisting in the wallet?

### Will zec-qt wallet remember my outgoing shielded sends?

Yes, by default zec-qt-wallet will store shielded sends in a local database as `zcashd` does not provide this information. You caan override this behaviour in the [Options](#) setting and can remove any stored transactions at any time (note that these will not be recoverable if you delete them).
