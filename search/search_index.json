In the res/ folder, you will find a number of *.ts files which contain the translations. If you don t find your language listed, please copy the zec-qt-wallet_template.ts file and use that. You can open the *.ts file (which is an XML file) and enter the translated strings manually using your favorite text editor, and enter the translations in the translation XML tag. It might be more productive to use the Qt Linguist tool, which provides a nice UI that has additional context and easily manages the strings for translations. Installing and using Qt Linguist You can install the Qt open source distribution from here , and that comes with Qt Linguist. You can launch it by launching /path/to/Qt5/bin/linguist res/zec_qt_wallet_ language code .ts . Windows and Mac builds for standalone Qt Linguist are available here Submitting translations Once you have updated the translations in the *.ts file, please create a pull request for the file. Please remember to confirm the translations from the Linguist menu (or remove the unfinished tag from XML element, if you are editing manually). Note that you don t have to translate all the strings. You can do this incrementally, and zec-qt-wallet will use all available translated strings, else fall back to English. Testing translations If you want to test the translations locally, you ll have to compile zec-qt-wallet. Please see compiling from source instructions.
